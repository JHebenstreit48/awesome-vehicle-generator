I also received advice when I got stuck for Argenis (Ruben) Dominguez, Carlin Shaw, hints from Leif Heitland. Phy Pham assisted me with the following code, but it only addressed a portion of the problems I was having at the time. I also had assistance from tutor Wesley Clements on 8/04/2024 as of resolving the errors that were in my code as of the day before. I also had assistance from Brandon Leek.

This is the example code that Phy Pham gave me when I got stuck:

then((answers) => {
  if(answers.vehicle === 'Truck'){
    console.log('Truck cannot tow itself');

Leif for example gave me the hint of using "instance of" and help me fix code that got out of order when I tried to add "if else" statements on CLi.ts. He helped me fixed startCLi method when it moved out of the CLi class when I started adding if else statements.

## Tests

npm run build and npm run start.
